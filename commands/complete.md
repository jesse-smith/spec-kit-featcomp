description: Mark a feature as complete after merging to main. Updates status headers and central registry.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Purpose

This command ensures consistent feature completion tracking across the project. Run this after merging a feature branch to main.

## Pre-flight Checks (MANDATORY)

Before proceeding, you MUST run these validation checks. If any fail, STOP and inform the user.

### Check 1: Branch Validation

Run: `git branch --show-current`

**STOP with error if** the current branch matches the pattern `###-*` (a feature branch).

Error message to show:
```
ERROR: Cannot run /speckit.featcomp.complete from a feature branch.

This command should be run from 'main' after merging a feature branch.

Correct workflow:
1. git checkout main
2. git merge ###-feature-name
3. /speckit.featcomp.complete
```

### Check 2: Task Completion Validation

For the feature being marked complete, run:
```bash
.specify/extensions/featcomp/scripts/bash/check-tasks-complete.sh specs/[###-feature-name]
```

**STOP with error if** the script exits with non-zero status (incomplete tasks).

Show the script output to the user and explain:
```
ERROR: Cannot mark feature as complete - there are incomplete tasks.

Complete all remaining tasks before marking the feature as done.
```

### Check 3: STATUS.md Exists

If `specs/STATUS.md` does not exist, create it from the template:
```bash
mkdir -p specs
cp .specify/extensions/featcomp/templates/STATUS.md specs/STATUS.md
```

## Steps

1. **Identify the feature**: Determine which feature was just completed.
   - If argument provided, use that feature name
   - Otherwise, check recent git history for merged feature branches (look for "Merge branch '###-" patterns)
   - Feature branches follow the pattern `###-feature-name` (e.g., `001-db-schema-explorer`)

2. **Locate feature documents**: Find all spec files in `specs/[###-feature-name]/`
   - Required: spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md
   - Optional: research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md

3. **Add status headers**: Add a completion header to each document immediately after the first heading:

   For spec.md:
   ```markdown
   # Feature Specification: [Name]

   > **STATUS: COMPLETE** | Merged: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Branch: `###-feature-name`
   ```

   For plan.md:
   ```markdown
   # Implementation Plan: [Name]

   > **STATUS: COMPLETE** | Merged: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Branch: `###-feature-name`
   ```

   For tasks.md:
   ```markdown
   # Tasks: [Name]

   > **STATUS: COMPLETE** | Merged: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Branch: `###-feature-name`
   ```

4. **Update central registry**: Edit `specs/STATUS.md`:
   - Find the row for this feature
   - If no row exists, add one
   - Change Status to "Complete"
   - Add the Merged Date
   - Update Notes if needed

5. **Commit the changes**:
   ```
   git add specs/
   git commit -m "docs: Mark [feature-name] as complete"
   ```

## Notes

- This command does NOT push to remote - that's a separate action
- Feature branches follow the `###-feature-name` naming convention
- Status headers use blockquote format for visual prominence in Markdown renderers
